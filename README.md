# South-Korea-AQI-Investigation-for-WGU-Capstone-Python

South Korea, home to nearly 52 million people, has grappled with air pollution for decades. Despite the modest improvement in air quality over time, the issue continues to result in health problems, which increase healthcare costs, hurt worker productivity, and disrupt entire sectors of the economy. These pollutants originate both domestically, from fossil fuel combustion, and internationally, with a significant portion of fine dust pollution blowing in from China. The primary pollutant is PM2.5, a type of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter and often more hazardous to human health due to the ease with which it enters the lungs.

Given the economic and health impacts of poor air quality, it is essential to build more robust models that predict the PM2.5 levels of a given day based on recent and historical trends in temperature and precipitation. In other words, through understanding meterological data, South Korea can better anticipate periods of heightened pollutant activity, protecting sensitive populations the health risk of breathing unclean air while reducing the broader economic burden posed by pollution.

Our primary question is: to what extent do daily temperature and precipitation indicate daily and yearly trends in PM2.5 values across South Korea? To work up to this central question, we will first conduct EDA and later experiment with modeling. For regional insights, we will focus on three different areas:

- Gwanak-gu, a district in Seoul (northwest, Seoul/Gyeonggi Province)
- Hyeoksin-dong, a neighborhood in Jeonju (southwest, North Jeolla Province)
- Cheongnim-dong, a neighborhood in Pohang (mid-east, North Gyeongsang Province)

This will allow us to understand geographical variations in our data.
